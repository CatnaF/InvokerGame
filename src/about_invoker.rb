def about_invoker
    puts "Carl, the Invoker, is known as one of the hardest characters to play and master in the game DOTA 2. The reason for this is because he is required to invoke his 10 spells with his reagents [Q]uas, [W]ex and [E]xort, depending on the situation in game. Other characters in DOTA 2 will have their abilities already set, so Invoker is a unique character in the game. Invoker was one of the earliest characters introduced in the original DOTA. You can learn more about Invoker in the link provided below. You can access the link by holding the Command key (âŒ˜), then double clicking the link, if you are using Mac."
